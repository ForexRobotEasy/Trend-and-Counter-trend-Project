# Trend and Counter Trend Project - ReadMe

This code is a sample implementation of the Trend and Counter Trend Project developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is a trading algorithm designed to identify trend and counter trend entry points and execute trades accordingly.

## Input Parameters
- `lotSize`: Specifies the lot size for each trade.
- `stopLoss`: Sets the stop loss level in pips.
- `takeProfit`: Sets the take profit level in pips.

## Global Variables
- `entryPrice`: Stores the entry price of the trade.
- `tradeOpen`: Flags whether a trade is currently open or not.

## Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called during the expert initialization process. This is where necessary indicators and variables are initialized.

## Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert is terminated. It performs necessary deinitialization tasks.

## Tick Function
The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the price. It contains the main logic of the expert advisor.

- If there is no open trade, it calculates the trend and counter trend entry points using the `CalculateTrendEntry()` and `CalculateCounterTrendEntry()` functions.
- It then executes a trade based on the entry points, choosing the one with the highest probability.
- If there is an open trade, it monitors the trades and adjusts the stop-loss and take-profit levels as necessary using the `MonitorTrades()` function.

## Calculate Trend Entry
The `CalculateTrendEntry()` function is where the algorithm for calculating the trend entry point is implemented. The actual calculations are not shown in the code.

## Calculate Counter Trend Entry
The `CalculateCounterTrendEntry()` function is where the algorithm for calculating the counter trend entry point is implemented. The actual calculations are not shown in the code.

## Execute Trade
The `ExecuteTrade()` function is responsible for executing a trade at the specified price and with the given trade type. It uses the `OrderSend()` function to open the trade.

## Monitor Trades
The `MonitorTrades()` function is responsible for monitoring open trades and adjusting the stop-loss and take-profit levels if necessary. It uses the `OrderModify()` function to modify the trade.

## Close Trades
The `CloseTrades()` function is not implemented in this code. It is meant to be the exit strategy for closing trades based on predefined criteria.
